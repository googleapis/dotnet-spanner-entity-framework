/// Cloud Spanner supports writing the commit timestamp of a row: https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/commit-timestamp
/// 
/// See the <see cref="Performance"/> entity in <see cref="SpannerSampleDbContext.OnModelCreating(Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.ModelBuilder)"/>
/// for the annotations that need to be set on the entity to automatically fill a commit timestamp value.
/// 
/// This feature has one limitation that should be taken into consideration before using it:
/// When writing a PENDING_COMMIT_TIMESTAMP to a table, that column will be unreadable for ALL rows in the table
/// for the remainder of the transaction. This means that you cannot execute any queries that reference this
/// column after calling SaveChanges during the same transaction.
/// NOTE: This is ONLY an issue if you use MANUAL transactions.
/// 
/// See also https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/commit-timestamp#dml
/// 
/// Run from the command line with `dotnet run CommitTimestampSample`
