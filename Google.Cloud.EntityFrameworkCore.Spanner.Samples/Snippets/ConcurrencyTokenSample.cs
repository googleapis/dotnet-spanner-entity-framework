/// Entity Framework Core supports concurrency handling using concurrency tokens:
/// https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/saving/concurrency
/// 
/// The sample model contains an abstract base entity VersionedEntity with one property 'Version'.
/// All concrete entities extend from this base entity and use the 'Version' property as a concurrency
/// token.
/// 
/// The concurrency token is automatically increased by the model every time an entity is updated.
/// This update happens in <see cref="SpannerSampleDbContext.UpdateVersions()"/>.
/// This means that if a row was updated by a different process between the moment that this process read
/// it and tries to write it, the other process will have updated the version number of the row and the
/// update by this process will fail with a <see cref="DbUpdateConcurrencyException"/>.
/// 
/// Run from the command line with `dotnet run ConcurrencyTokenSample`
/// </summary>
